\section{Conclusion}
The application of neural network models to intrusion detection systems seems to be very promising. (Sun and Nguyen) demonstrated that using a convolutional neural
network improved performance and accuracy of their models when compared to past research. (Yang) showed similar results when utilizing an Attention-LTSM model, with 
the added benefit of showing improvements to robustness. These three papers demonstrate that using neural networks in intrusion detection is feasible and can 
improve on current IDS technology both in accuracy and efficiency. They also lay a firm groundwork for future research in this area.
