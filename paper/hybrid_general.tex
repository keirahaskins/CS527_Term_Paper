\section{Hybrid and General AI Techniques for Building Intrusion Detection Systems}
%\citeN{kanimozhi19,idris05,botha01}
In this section we will focus on looking at papers which focus on either a hybrid or general approach
when using artificial intelligence in designing intrusion detection systems. Specifically the three
papers; \citeN{kanimozhi19,idris05,botha01}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \cite{botha01} Focuses on building a hybrid/dynamic intrusion detection system based on trend 
    analysis, neural networks, and fuzzy logic.
    \item The primary contribution of \cite{idris05}, is that of building a hybrid intrusion detection
    system which focuses on combining fuzzy logic and neural networks with network profiling.
    \item The researchers in \cite{kanimozhi19} focus on 
\end{enumerate}
