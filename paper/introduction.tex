\section{Introduction}
This section will be completed with contribution from both Rei (Keira) Haskins and Jonathan Robinson.

Network security is a growing issue in the field of information assurance and cybersecurity. The types of network attacks are also growing, and the methods used to detect them need to be improved upon (Yang). Intrusion Detection Systems are a primary tool used to detect malicious network traffic, primarily by detecting signatures of attack traffic (Nguyen). There are many areas of study in how to improve current intrusion detection systems. In the next sections of this paper, we detail general and hybrid approaches, as well as how neural networks can be used to improve accuracy and performance. 

%\subsection{Research Hypotheses}
%\label{sec:hyp}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Newly created coins are more likely to borrow code and or particular features from newer coins rather than older ones due to improvement in the cryptocurrenhttps://www.overleaf.com/project/5e18b94d620d5d00011732bdcy landscape as a whole.
%    \begin{enumerate}
%        \item Corollary: The developers of newer coins have an easier time implementing new features or design choices as compared to older coins.
%    \end{enumerate}
%    \item Newly created coins borrow code from Bitcoin over time as Bitcoin can provide a solid foundation for security properties and consensus mechanisms which are difficult to implement from scratch.
%    \item Older, better established coins such as Bitcoin borrow code or features from other newer coins.
%    \begin{enumerate}
%        \item Corollary: Newer coins are more likely to have either borrowed or developed new features which may be appealing to older coins.
%        \item Corollary: Key functions are copied often; less important functions are not copied at all. For example improvements to security models, enhanced cryptography, consensus models,
